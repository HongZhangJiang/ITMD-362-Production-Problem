# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: I choose different blue because blue is one of cool colors and gives an impression of calm. I think it is the menâ€™s color and the most people who will visit this website are men.  

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: I choose green because I think this color presents life and growing. When I see green color, I will think about green leaves and organic vegetables. 

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: I think blue present men and red present women. However, I do not want to use a high contrast of complementary color. That means I do not want men and women fight each other. Even they have different personality, they can live together. In the other hand, a banking website will server for all kinds of people which include men and women. I hope men or women will like this combination.  

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Explanation of your color choices: In this palette, I let red dominate and use blue for accent because I think children will like warm colors more than cool colors. As you see, the palette all uses dark colors because I think children will not like light colors.
