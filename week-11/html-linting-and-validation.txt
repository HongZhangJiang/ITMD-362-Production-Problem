# Production Problem 6: HTML De-Linting and Validation

## The Problem

Using the HTML Tidy tool, installed as a command-line tool on your computer via instructions at http://www.html-tidy.org, and the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org, rework the HTML file in this directory (`index.html`) so that is free from errors.

## Resources

* HTML Tidy: http://www.html-tidy.org/
* HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org/

## Deliverables

1. First, run HTML Tidy on the index.html file. Copy and paste the errors here:
line 6 column 5 - Warning: <meta> unexpected or duplicate quote mark
line 10 column 46 - Warning: <img> attribute with missing trailing quote mark
line 10 column 7 - Warning: missing </a>
Info: Document content looks like HTML5
3 warnings, 0 errors were found!

(Note: download the windows binary tidy.exe and run tidy in cmd. 
command: tidy -f check.txt index.html
check.txt is the file with errors in index.html.)

2. Fix as many errors as are listed by HTML Tidy, and re-run until there are no errors reported. HINT: Always fix the first error reported, then re-run tidy. Then, run the contents of `index.html` through the HTML validator. List any errors that the validator reports here:
If I run the orginal index.html in HTML validator, here is the errors:
Error: = in an unquoted attribute value. Probable causes: Attributes running together or a URL query string in an unquoted attribute value.

Then, I run tidy again and fix the erros.
(Note: here is the command: tidy -o output.html index.html
output.html is the file fixed by tidy.)

run output.html in HTML validator, here is the result, no errors:
Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show. 

3. Finally, fix the errors that are listed by the HTML validator, and commit the `index.html` file in its error-free state.

4. Bonus: What error remained that neither Tidy nor the validator did not catch? Fix it, if you've not already, and mark as its own commit.
I found the file fixed by vidy changed some content. Then, I fix it by myself. Then, I run it in the HTML validator and shows no errors.
