# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: with its middle chair back, mobile feet, red sponge seat cushion, soft armrests, this office chair creates a composition that is a pleasure to look at. 

* Behavioral: in behavioral level, there are a back that adjusts to different angles, a seat that adjusts to different height, and the feet that can move. These functions are all designed for ergonomic comfort.

* Reflective: Many parts can adjusts or move. It means anyone can find the comfortble pose when he or she sit in this chair.  

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:
