# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): 
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: 
My design comes from the Apple iOS HCI Guidelines. Apple uses the themes, deference, clarity and depth. Hence, this design uses pictures to layout the menu because the pictures are simpler than the text and easy to understand. Users just click these pictures to get what they want. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
This design comes from Android Design Guidelines. Android prefers Material Design. It emphasizes usersâ€™ touching feeling and text content. Then, I decide to use these text bars to design the menu. Another important thing is I use search bar on the top of it. It is simple too but need users to interact with them.
