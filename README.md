A repository of the Production Problems for ITMD362: Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design. See http://ks4.us/hci

Week one: the orginal file is in https://github.com/HongZhangJiang/ITMD-362.git. When I create this repository, I used the professor's repository as the original one. Hence, there were two contributors. In week two, I have to create a new one, https://github.com/HongZhangJiang/ITMD-362-Production-Problem.git
